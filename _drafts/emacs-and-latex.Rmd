title: Emacs with LaTeX for Academic Writing
---

Having a super powerful text editor can make your life much
easier. There are quite a few out there, but there's only that can do
it all: Emacs. 

![emacs](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/real_programmers.png)

Emacs is incredibly powerful, and ancient (in computer terms,
anyway). Ancient as in it was invented before keyboards had arrow
keys. Oh, and before Windows, Mac, or Linux existed as operating
systems. So it can be a bit... weird, at times. For example, its
built-in tutorial (which I recommend you never even look at) tells you
that the best way to change lines is to use control-n or control-p
(for next and previous). While this was probably more helpful when
keyboards didn't have arrow keys, it seems silly to me now. So what
exactly is Emacs and why am I recommending it if it's that old?

Emacs is a text editor, kinda. It can edit text, true, but it can also
run tetris out of the box. Or, ya know,
[check your email](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/CategoryMail), run
[twitter](https://github.com/hayamiz/twittering-mode/tree/master),
or act as your
[file manager](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Dired.html).
Or pretty much anything else you might want it to do. 

# Install Emacs
The first thing to note is that "Emacs" actually refers to a whole
class of editors. The most popular is
[GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), and that is the one
I recommend. GNU Emacs is free and open source software with a huge
development community.

* **Linux**: For Ubuntu, you can just do `sudo apt-get install emacs24`
for the latest version as of this writing.[^ppa]

* **Windows**: For Windows, you can go
  [here](http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/emacs/windows/) and download the
  most recent version ending in .zip. As of this writing, that is
  "emacs-24.5-bin-i686-mingw32.zip". To use, you need to unzip the
  folder. There's no installation necessary - just use the file
  there. To uninstall, just delete the folder.

* **Mac**: For Mac, go [here](http://emacsformacosx.com/). Download
  and install like normal. If you use Homebrew, you can also get emacs
  through there, though it may not be as up-to-date. 

[^ppa]: If you really want the bleeding edge, you can use the ppa
    [here](https://launchpad.net/~ubuntu-elisp/+archive/ubuntu/ppa).

# MELPA
Emacs is super old, so it hasn't always had the ability to manage your
packages for you through the internet. This was added relatively
recently, in fact. You'll want to enable Emacs work with MELPA, which
is an online package archive. This is super easy - just follow the
instructions [here](https://melpa.org/#/getting-started). MELPA has a
ton of packages - way more than you'll ever want. I'll walk though
some of the most important here, though.

# Using LaTeX
The package you want to use for working with LaTeX is called "AuCTeX."
It has a website [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/), but you
can just get it through MELPA.

# Reference Management

In particular, there is a "minor mode" called RefTeX that is like a godsend for reference management.
There are two ways for RefTeX to find your .bib file:

1. You can set up a default .bib file via your `.emacs` file. So you can set the reftex-default-bibliography variable like so: `(setq reftex-default-bibliography '("path/to/bibfile.bib"))` where you replace `path/to/bibfile.bib` with the path on your system. You can also have multiple bibliographies there, since it is a list.

2. RefTeX should automatically find your .bib file through the `\bibliography{}` LaTeX command. So if you've set up your bibliography in your LaTeX file, RefTeX should find it.

Note that you can use either the first *or* the second way, but not both.

Once you have that set up, you need to turn on RefTeX (which is a minor mode) in AuCTeX.
Just search google for how to do this; it's relatively easy.
You can also take a look at my `.emacs` file [on Github](https://github.com/jabranham/emacs), which should give you an idea of what you need to do.

Once you've got that down, you're good to go!
Just start up emacs, and open up a .tex file (make sure that AuCTeX is the major mode and that RefTeX is active as a minor mode).
The keyboard shortcut for a citation is `C-c [`.
This will bring up a menu that looks something like this:

![RefTeX citation options](/image/reftex-options.jpg)

As you can see, these are all the different citation formats.
So, if we want the `\citep{}` command, we simply press `p`.
At that point, we can put in a search term and RefTeX will search through our .bib file for matches.
You can search for authors, titles, etc.
So for example, if I am looking for something to do with policy, but I can't remember the authors, I just type in "policy" and press enter (return).
RefTeX will then look through my .bib file and return any matches it sees.
This will look something like this:

![RefTeX matches](/image/reftex-bib-keys.jpg)

I can navigate through the listings to select the one that I want.
Once I'm on it, hitting enter will automatically insert the selection into my tex file.

If I've searched for something too broad ("policy", for example) and need to narrow the search, I can press `r` to search inside my results.
So if I was interested in policy pieces that Erikson has written, I can just type `r Erikson` and it will narrow the choices to just those pieces that mention both policy and Erikson. 

And that's it!
RefTeX is a pretty powerful tool.
It can also handle more advanced features, like keeping track of your other references in your document (like Equations, Figures, Tables, etc).
