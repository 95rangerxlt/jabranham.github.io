# Emacs with RefTeX
Emacs is incredibly powerful.
It's a text editor, kinda.
It can edit text, true, but it can also run tetris out of the box.
Or, ya know, check your email, run twitter, or act as your file manager.
Or pretty much anything else you might want it to do. 
Of particular interest for us (for this blog post, anyway) is that it can act as a super powerful reference manager. 

In particular, there is a "minor mode" called RefTeX that is like a godsend for reference management.
There are two ways for RefTeX to find your .bib file:

1. You can set up a default .bib file via your `.emacs` file. So you can set the reftex-default-bibliography variable like so: `(setq reftex-default-bibliography '("path/to/bibfile.bib"))` where you replace `path/to/bibfile.bib` with the path on your system. You can also have multiple bibliographies there, since it is a list.

2. RefTeX should automatically find your .bib file through the `\bibliography{}` LaTeX command. So if you've set up your bibliography in your LaTeX file, RefTeX should find it.

Note that you can use either the first *or* the second way, but not both.

Once you have that set up, you need to turn on RefTeX (which is a minor mode) in AuCTeX.
Just search google for how to do this; it's relatively easy.
You can also take a look at my `.emacs` file [on Github](https://github.com/jabranham/emacs), which should give you an idea of what you need to do.

Once you've got that down, you're good to go!
Just start up emacs, and open up a .tex file (make sure that AuCTeX is the major mode and that RefTeX is active as a minor mode).
The keyboard shortcut for a citation is `C-c [`.
This will bring up a menu that looks something like this:

![RefTeX citation options](/image/reftex-options.jpg)

As you can see, these are all the different citation formats.
So, if we want the `\citep{}` command, we simply press `p`.
At that point, we can put in a search term and RefTeX will search through our .bib file for matches.
You can search for authors, titles, etc.
So for example, if I am looking for something to do with policy, but I can't remember the authors, I just type in "policy" and press enter (return).
RefTeX will then look through my .bib file and return any matches it sees.
This will look something like this:

![RefTeX matches](/image/reftex-bib-keys.jpg)

I can navigate through the listings to select the one that I want.
Once I'm on it, hitting enter will automatically insert the selection into my tex file.

If I've searched for something too broad ("policy", for example) and need to narrow the search, I can press `r` to search inside my results.
So if I was interested in policy pieces that Erikson has written, I can just type `r Erikson` and it will narrow the choices to just those pieces that mention both policy and Erikson. 

And that's it!
RefTeX is a pretty powerful tool.
It can also handle more advanced features, like keeping track of your other references in your document (like Equations, Figures, Tables, etc).
