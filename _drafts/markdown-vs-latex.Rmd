I hope that my last post convinced everyone that they need to use at least some kind of version control.
Near the end of that post, I noted that git (and github) are geared towards plain text files. 
In this post, I hope to convince you that plain text is your friend. 
If you're coming from word processing land (a la Microsoft Word or similar), then there can be a bit of a learning curve. 
But the flexibility and power you gain far outweigh the costs of switching.
