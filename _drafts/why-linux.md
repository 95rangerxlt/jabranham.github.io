I use linux as my operating system, which is definitely not the norm.
Probably most people in the world use MS Windows and most people in my
department use a Mac. So why do I use Linux?

Two separate rationales here. There's one (rather funny/silly) reason
for why I started with Linux, and another set of reasons for why I
stuck with it. I'll go through each separately here. 

# Why I started with Linux

In the summer of 2015, Microsoft released the Windows 10 operating
system. My laptop immediately began to pester me to upgrade, so about
a week after the release I did so. Which was a mistake. After my
laptop rebooted into the new "better" OS, I noticed that the trackpad
wasn't working as well - it would move the cursor around the screen,
but dragging with two fingers wouldn't scroll anything. Since that's
the main way that I scroll down webpages and the like, this minor bug
was actually a pretty big inconvenience whenever I tried to scroll
(damn you, muscle memory!). 

So I called Microsoft support, since MS said that they would provide
support for all customers with their upgrade experience. 

Mistake. After spending hours on hold and with different people
telling me different things, I was eventually told to call Dell's
technical support (it's a Dell laptop). So I did that. 

Mistake. Dell gave me the runaround for a while before telling me that
I should contact Microsoft again. Rather than do that, I tried to
revert to Windows 8. After all, Microsoft had sold Windows 10 partly
because they said that you could easily revert back to your previous
version of Windows if you didn't like it. 

Mistake. That didn't work at all. At this point I was left with a
perfectly functioning computer, except that it wouldn't boot into any
sort of functional operating system. 

At this point I had two options: One, I could call Microsoft again and
explain everything that happened and hope that they could help. After
all the time on the phone with them and Dell, though, I really didn't
relish that idea again. 

Two, I could install this other operating system I had sorta kinda
heard of but knew basically nothing about: Linux. 

At this point, I was upset (which might be an understatement) with
Microsoft/Dell/Windows, so I decided to say "F**k it" and install
Linux.

Not a mistake. (Finally!) 

# Why I stayed with Linux

Ohmygod so many reasons.[^1] There have been tons of articles written
on all of the advantages of Linux (especially as compared to
Windows!). I especially love the fact that there are basically no
viruses. Oh, and your computer doesn't mysteriously get slower as time
goes on. There's also all kinds of privacy advantages. Finally,
[linux is more ethical than windows or apple's os](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.en.html).
Those are all super important reasons for why linux is better than
windows or apple's OS. I want to highlight a few more reasons:

1. Package management
2. Unix 

### Disadvantages of linux

# How do you switch? 

[^1]: One of which is definitely the fact that it doesn't mercilessly
    bug you with updates. Or randomly restart your computer to install
    said updates that it's downloaded without your knowledge or
    permission!
