I use linux as my operating system, which is definitely not the norm.
So why do I do that? 

# Why I started with Linux
In the summer of 2015, Microsoft released the Windows 10 operating
system. My laptop immediately began to pester me to upgrade, so about
a week after the release I did so. Which was a mistake. After my
laptop rebooted into the new "better" OS, I noticed that the trackpad
wasn't working as well - it would move the cursor around the screen,
but dragging with two fingers wouldn't scroll anything. Since that's
the main way that I scroll down webpages and the like, this minor bug
was actually a pretty big inconvenience whenever I tried to scroll
(damn you, muscle memory!). 

So I called Microsoft support, since MS said that they would provide
support for all customers with their upgrade experience. 

Mistake. After spending hours on hold and with different people
telling me different things, I was eventually told to call Dell's
technical support (it's a Dell laptop). So I did that. 

Mistake. Dell gave me the runaround for a while before telling me that
I should contact Microsoft again.
