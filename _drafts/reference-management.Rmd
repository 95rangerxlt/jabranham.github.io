title: Reference Management
---

So as a grad student, I write a lot.
Like, a lot a lot.
And as a part of that, I cite a lot of articles and books.
And there are, of course, those few articles that I find myself citing in nearly every paper I write.
So ideally, I could have one central repository for all of the papers that I want to be able to cite, and reference that from whatever paper I'm working on.
Then, whatever program I'm using to convert the plain text to a good looking document (LaTeX, for example) should be able to take combine the citations from the text of the document with the information from this central repository and output properly formatted citations, as well as a properly formatted bibliography.
Luckily, this is very easy to do.

The big picture is that you'll keep all of your references in a .bib file.
You can call it anything, so long as the file extension is .bib.
My default name for these is `library.bib`, but you can really use whatever.
Then, LaTeX (or markdown, if you're using that) can talk to this file using a program called BibTeX.
So in your LaTeX document, all you need to do to cite something is call a simple command (`\citep{}`, for example) and then insert a "key" linking what you want to cite with an entry in the .bib file.
Then, at the end of your LaTeX document, you can simply tell it to include a bibliography and specify the style you want (APSR, for example).
All of the formatting and inserting the actual citation will be taken care of.
Magically, in my opinion.

So although there's a bit of setup cost, once you've done that (once), you can just write your document and simply drop in citations with a simple command (like `\cite{}`).
Good editors will let you search through your .bib file for the reference you want without actually opening it.
The format of the citations and the reference list will be automatically inserted and properly formatted.

It will seem a little overwhelming to set up, but fear not.
It is actually really simple.
Setup may take a bit, but once you have that down you shouldn't need to do it again.
Even if you do (say, for a second computer), it will be much easier. 

# The .bib file
In my last post, I briefly mentioned that you should write your files in plain text.
This applies to your bibliography files as well.
There is a pretty standardized way to format your bibliography files: the ".bib" file.
Your .bib file contains information about each reference you want.
So, for example, if you wanted to cite [Understanding Interaction Models}(http://pan.oxfordjournals.org/content/14/1/63.short) (which everyone should read), your .bib file would contain something like the following: 

    @article{brambor2006,
        title={Understanding Interaction Models: Improving Empirical Analyses},
        author={Brambor, Thomas and Clark, William Roberts and Golder, Matt},
        journal={Political Analysis},
        volume={14},
        number={1},
        pages={63--82},
        year={2006},
    }

The `@` says to begin a new reference.
We then say what kind of thing it is (in this case, an article).
Everything between the curly braces is information about the reference.
So we have information about the title, author, the journal that it's in, etc.
The very first thing ("brambor2006" in this case) is called a bibtex key.
That's how you'll link up the references in your LaTeX (or markdown or whatever) file to the references in your .bib file. 
Lucky for us, we don't actually have to remember how to format all this.
Do google scholar search, and underneath the reference that we want, click "cite" then click "BibTeX" in the window that pops up.
It should then pop up with information similar to what I've posted above.

Let me be clear - this .bib file is all you need to do reference management from a LaTeX document.
Everything else I suggest here are simply tools to make it easier to manage your .bib file or to integrate it into your writing. 

# .bib file management programs
There are a lot of different programs out there that can manage your .bib file (and sync it across computers).
Some of them that I know of are JabRef, Mendeley, and Zotero.
A few Mac people I know use Bibdesk.
There's also a program that runs in emacs that manages .bib datases ([ebib](http://joostkremers.github.io/ebib/)).
I may move to ebib soon, but for now I'm using Zotero.
[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is a pretty nice bibliography management system.[^zotero]
It can manage your pdf files as well as sync your bibliography across multiple computers.
There is a plug in that allows you to export your bibliography as a .bib file: [Better BibTeX](https://zotplus.github.io/better-bibtex/).
The Better BibTeX plugin can also keep the .bib file updated, so if you add a reference to zotero, it will automatically add it to your .bib file.

That's all I use Zotero for, but I think it has many more features.
It seems to be able to manage pdf files and images and whatnot.
Maybe I should put more effort into learning what Zotero can do, but for now I just use it to sync my .bib file between computers and projects.
I honestly havne't played around with it much yet, but it seems to do what I need it to do really well.
If you aren't writing in plain text, Zotero can also integrate with Word and OpenOffice. 

[^zotero]: It's also open source! 

# Auto-completion
This is just a quick note about auto-completion.
You *need* to get an editor that has auto-completion for your references.
It will make your life so much easier.
So, for example, one way to cite things in LaTeX is with the `\citep{}` command.
A good editor will connect your .bib file and your .tex file intelligently so that you don't have to remember all those bibtex keys.
So, for example, you can just type `\citep{` and it will pop up with a list of completions.
The best programs will let you search your .bib file and find the reference you want.
The best of the best (e.g. emacs) let you search via title, author(s), year, etc. 

# Emacs with RefTeX
Emacs is incredibly powerful.
It's a text editor, kinda.
It can edit text, true, but it can also run tetris out of the box.
Or, ya know, check your email, run twitter, or act as your file manager.
Or pretty much anything else you might want it to do. 
Of particular interest for us (for this blog post, anyway) is that it can act as a super powerful reference manager. 

In particular, there is a "minor mode" called RefTeX that is like a godsend for reference management.
There are two ways for RefTeX to find your .bib file:

1. You can set up a default .bib file via your `.emacs` file. So you can set the reftex-default-bibliography variable like so: `(setq reftex-default-bibliography '("path/to/bibfile.bib"))` where you replace `path/to/bibfile.bib` with the path on your system. You can also have multiple bibliographies there, since it is a list.

2. RefTeX should automatically find your .bib file through the `\bibliography{}` LaTeX command. So if you've set up your bibliography in your LaTeX file, RefTeX should find it.

Note that you can use either the first *or* the second way, but not both.

Once you have that set up, you need to turn on RefTeX (which is a minor mode) in AuCTeX.
Just search google for how to do this; it's relatively easy.
You can also take a look at my `.emacs` file [on Github](https://github.com/jabranham/emacs), which should give you an idea of what you need to do.

Once you've got that down, you're good to go!
Just start up emacs, and open up a .tex file (make sure that AuCTeX is the major mode and that RefTeX is active as a minor mode).
The keyboard shortcut for a citation is `C-c [`.
This will bring up a menu that looks something like this:

![RefTeX citation options](/image/reftex-options.jpg)

As you can see, these are all the different citation formats.
So, if we want the `\citep{}` command, we simply press `p`.
At that point, we can put in a search term and RefTeX will search through our .bib file for matches.
You can search for authors, titles, etc.
So for example, if I am looking for something to do with policy, but I can't remember the authors, I just type in "policy" and press enter (return).
RefTeX will then look through my .bib file and return any matches it sees.
This will look something like this:

![RefTeX matches](/image/reftex-bib-keys.jpg)

I can navigate through the listings to select the one that I want.
Once I'm on it, hitting enter will automatically insert the selection into my tex file.

If I've searched for something too broad ("policy", for example) and need to narrow the search, I can press `r` to search inside my results.
So if I was interested in policy pieces that Erikson has written, I can just type `r Erikson` and it will narrow the choices to just those pieces that mention both policy and Erikson. 

And that's it!
RefTeX is a pretty powerful tool.
It can also handle more advanced features, like keeping track of your other references in your document (like Equations, Figures, Tables, etc).
