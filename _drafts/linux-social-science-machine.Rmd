I put together a guide to how to set up your Linux machine for
quantitative work. It is based loosely on the guide put together by
Jake Bowers and Jeff Gill available
[here](https://github.com/jwbowers/SocialScienceMacConfig).

Much (most? all?) of the guide applies to Macs and Windows based
machines, although the installation instructions may differ. 

The guide is available
[on Github](https://github.com/jabranham/SocialScienceLinuxConfig),
and I have copied the readme file here. I encourage you to go to the
github repository, as it may be updated and differ from the text
here.
